### `session_summary.sh`
A simple shell script that provides a user session summary:

- User name
- Host name
- Current directory

**Run the script:**
```bash
chmod +x session_summary.sh
./session_summary.sh
```
## Branching Strategy

- **main:** Stable, production-ready code

- **dev:** Primary development branch, integrates feature branches

- **feature/*:** Short-lived branches for individual tasks, e.g., feature/session-summary

2. Created `dev` branch for development

5. Pushed feature branch and created Pull Request â†’ merged into `dev`

6. Merged `dev` into `main` for release

7. Added `.gitignore` and `TASKS.md` for documentation
